Hi! This is a SQL Editor that allows you to edit and run SQL code from a file, as well as view the created tables.

## Setup

No need to install any dependencies! <br>
Open the command line at the root directory and run:
<br>
```python app```


If you want to launch it on Chrome, run: 
<br>
```python app -b chrome```

Similarly, if you want to launch it on Firefox, run: 
<br>
```python app -b firefox```

This will start the editor on your local server, and launch a new browser window with the IP address specified in the command line (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
